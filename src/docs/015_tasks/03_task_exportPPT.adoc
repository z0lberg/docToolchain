== About This Task

This task lets you export a series of PowerPoint slides to be used within your AsciiDoc documentation.
It is currently a Windows-only task.

It exports the slides as `.jpg` files and the speaker notes as one `.adoc` file.
The tag `{slide}` within the speaker notes will be replaced with the corresponding image reference.
This will help you to get a stable result, even when you insert or delete slides.

Use the {url1}[tagged regions (`//tag::[]`) feature of asciidoctor] to include only certain slides or parts of your speaker notes.
